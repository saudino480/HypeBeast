Webscrapper for Grailed T-shirts

Contained in this repo is the project: "Who's Afraid of the Hypebeast?" which was completed around Summer 2019.

The idea of the project was to ingest information from a website, in this case Grailed.com, in order to understand how the label of the clothes affects how much those clothes cost. For instance, How much more is a t-shirt made by Gucci as opposed to one made by Gilden? And could that information be used in order to give consumers in the aftermarket make informed decisions about their second hand street wear? I come to a couple of conclusions in my article, [here](www.google.com).
